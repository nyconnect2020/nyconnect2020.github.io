                                Currently only two thirds of NYC households have access to a wired broadband connection.
                                We created this dashboard to appreciate in red the Census tracts with broadband internet
                                adoption rates lower than 66% (i.e. two-thirds).

                                Visually we can see that the Bronx as a whole struggles with low adoption rates,
                                whereas the other boroughs have smaller more concentrated hotspots like in Williamsburg,
                                the Lower East Side, and Borough Park.
                                Additionally, to add more color to this visualization, it includes information about
                                income rates and the number of unique internet
                                service providers (ISPs) found in eacn Census tract.

                                As we can discover through the dashboard, areas with the most disparaties in broadband
                                subscription (Wired Broadband < 0.66) come from areas with low income (00-50k> 0.50),
                                    while the number of ISPs don't seem to have much of an impact on
                                    broadband adoption rates.

                                At the scale of census tracts, internet service infrastructure displays strong signs of
                                spatial autocorrelation.
                                There are clusters of spatially contiguous census tracts that share similar levels of

                            Much like the Pricing Regression results of the supply and demand of ISPs, the Spatial
                            Regressions showed that
                            income levels were significant variables in determining broadband subscription rates.

                            Census tracts with more wealthier residents are associated with higher subscription rates.
                            More interestingly, the number of ISPs was negatively correlated with subscription rates.
                            These findings might imply that in the long-run, an increase in the number of ISPs can
                            result in market
                            fragmentation that reduces subscription rates.

                            The pricing regression identified a significant negative correlation in the demand side,
                            and a significant positive correlation in the supply side.
                            These result agree with microeconomic theory that states that higher prices for a good leads
                            to

                            Furthermore the results showed that race and borough were factors of significant influence

                            Mobile service is the most commonly mentioned kerword/phrase in negative tweets.
                            Some of the other significant keywords (e.g. internet, data, wifi, cable, network, speed,

                            in NYC but also on how to address service quality.
